    <p>
    In the interviews conducted the two students agreed that NC State did a decent job on campus of promoting and providing healthy options but they could do better. Defining what is healthy on campus to students was an issue that one interviewee said should be addressed at the beginning of student’s college career. Telling students about the relationship of the food they consume and general well being was also thought to be an important teaching point. Recognizing on campus resources, such as a dietitian at the gym, is a valuable resource.  Many students would benefit with an appointment with this expert in nutrition. In my own research, I observed that students come in with varying backgrounds with food, some knowing the importance of healthy options and others lacking. A study by the University of Toronto showed that if campus dining would take the time to inform students about what they are putting in their bodies, it can result in a positive change in more healthy options being consumed. Providing students with new foods and encouraging them about the health benefits can help them overcome Food Neophobia. This has usually developed during childhood but once overcome, nutritious eating habits can be instilled. Most universities require freshmen to have a meal plan so that they are guaranteed food on campus. It is important that universities inform students about the healthy options available to them as this is their main source of food. Overall there seem to be three main points, teaching students about nutrition, providing healthy options and resources on campus, and advertising these healthy options, resources, and nutrition tips.

      <p>The buffet style of dining halls can be overwhelming for many students and as a result they pile up their plates with food that they do not know the nutrition facts behind them. But are these nutrition facts being made available and would they choose differently if they knew what was in the food they choose?</p>

  <h2>Interviews</h2>
  <div class="w3-row">
  <div class="w3-col w3-container m6 l5 w3-orange">
    <p>Claire Garner, NC State Student</p>
   <p>

Interviewer: Do you eat at One Earth often on campus?  <p>

 <p> Claire: I eat at One Earth a lot just because they have so many different healthy options as opposed to other options on campus. <p>

 <p> Interviewer: So you say you try to eat pretty healthy?  <p>

 <p> Claire: I do, I try to eat healthy.  <p>

 <p> Interviewer: Do you think that that is decently easy or is it difficult with trying to find options on campus? <p>

 <p> Claire: I think it can definitely be difficult on campus because there’s not a whole lot of options so like maybe the food that is healthy is food that you don’t enjoy eating but like discipline and just eating healthier food you’ll start to like them more but it just takes being hard on yourself a little bit. <p>

 <p> Interview: Do you think that NC State as a whole does a decent job at providing students with tools to eat healthy? <p>

 <p> Claire: I think they do do a decent job, I think they can do better um, for instance like I have some friends that are like vegan and there’s not like many options out there for like variations so there’s really like only One Earth and many of the other restaurants so if that’s what they want then they are kinda stuck but I think they do do a decent job but they could do better providing more options to vegans. <p>

 <p> Interviewer: Do you have any ideas as to like things that you wished state offered to educate like you’re talking about eating and just the importance of it?  <p>

 <p> Claire: Um, I think it would maybe be brought up at orientation more because I know at orientation they talk about like your different food options and stuff like that but they don’t really talk much about like why it’s important, also like there’s definitely like a lot of programs on campus that help with anxiety and depression and like all the other stuff that people are going through in college but like I think so much of a part of like just feeling good which is what a lot of that stems to is fueling your body with good things so when that that’s not like incorporated into teaching and like resources that are given to people it’s not really going help as much as other things. <p>

     <p>Lauren Muir, NC State Student</p>

    <p>Interviewer: Do you think that N.C. State as a whole does a good job at promoting healthy eating on campus? <p>

 <p> Lauren: I think that they do, I think it’s hard because healthy food is hard to do fresh produce, and it’s hard to feed so many people fresh food. But, I do think they make a good effort. I like seeing the “Whole Food” logo on things to know they are their better option, but I think defining the word healthy can be tricky and I would be curious as to what the University’s definition of “healthy” is and seeing what qualifies to go under that “pack-approved” logo. Sometimes I see that logo and think, “Oh, cool, I’m gonna get that”, but then sometimes, I question why it’s considered healthy. <p>

 <p> Interviewer: What dictates your decision to go to one dining option over the other? <p>

 <p> Lauren: Uh, a lot of times it’s social. It’s because I know people that are going there, but I also don’t have a meal plan. So anytime I want to eat on campus, I pay out of pocket for it, and it’s a decision if it’s worth it to eat on campus or not. So, if it were a dining hall, I look ahead and see what is on the menu to see if It’s something I’m actually gonna want to eat. A lot of times with One Earth especially, I really like the food they have, but a lot of times it’s $9 and I’m still hungry after. <p>

 <p> Interviewer: Do you think that there are any tools that N.C. State could provide its students to aid them in healthy eating or just more knowledge of nutrition, overall? <p>

 <p> Lauren: Yeah, for me, I have a minor in nutrition, so my study here includes learning about those types of things. In my classes, I’ve tracked my food, I’ve tracked my calories, tracked different vitamins and macros and micros, and looking what I need for, what I don’t have enough of, where I can find that on campus. That’s for me specifically, but not everybody takes those classes, I’ve specifically had exposure to that at N.C. State. Having that information accessible in dining halls and having information sessions, or something along those lines, just for people who want to know what that looks like.

  <h2>MyPlate</h2>
    <p> Everyones plate will look differently but if a model plate was displayed in dining halls, would students occasionally choose to follow this model? </p>

According to the USDA, the ideal plate follows the portions displayed to the left. marketed as MyPlate, this serves as a reminder of how you should try to eat every food group with each meal.

    Following MyPlate as a model I created a plate at a dining hall on campus. I found options for each food group easily. </p>
